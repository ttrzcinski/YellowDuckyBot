# YellowDuckyBot
Should help user by asking questions about the code until user reaches "Aaahhh" moment.

It is based on simpleEchoBot from https://github.com/ttrzcinski/Microsoft.Bot.Sample.SimpleEchoBot.

TODO:
- Add some sort of memory to bot in order not to repeat questions, if answer was already given.
- Read questions from some externalized form, like JSON tree or some small DataBase.
- Add a way to extend known list of questions from user's point, like special commands "ADD_QUESTION: Did You run static Analysis?/Yes/No"
- Taking care of git commands for user
